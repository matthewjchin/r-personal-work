# r-personal-work
R code that I am posting to showcase what I have learned as both a graduate student and as someone who works on personal projects and contributes to open source libraries. 

<br>

This repository will also contain some Python notebooks via Jupyter for additional context and comparison between the Python and R programming languages.

<br>

Any of the file names can be found from the [R-lang repository](https://github.com/shifteight/R-lang) on GitHub. The specific folder in the repository of all file names from which were loaded from can be found [here](https://github.com/shifteight/R-lang/tree/master/TRB/data).
